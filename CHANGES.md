# Changes Made to Fix the Implementation

## API Endpoint Versions Updated

1. Updated endpoints to use the correct API versions:
   - Changed `/v3/elements` to `/v2/elements`
   - Changed `/v3/elements/{id}` to `/v2/elements/{id}`
   - Changed `/v3/intervals` to `/v1/intervals`
   - Changed `/v3/groups` to `/v1/groups`

2. Fixed parameter structure:
   - Added required `searchType` parameter (set to '2') for elements endpoints
   - Changed `workspaceIds` to singular `workspaceId` for v1 endpoints
   - Changed `pageSize` parameter to `limit` for elements endpoint

3. Updated team/group handling:
   - Changed reference from `groups` to `teams` in elements response
   - Changed `groupIds` parameter to `teamIds` for filtering

## Server Integration

1. Updated the MCP server to properly use the OboardClient implementation
2. Removed mock data in favor of real API calls
3. Added proper tools for searching OKRs, getting a specific OKR, and fetching cycles and teams

## Documentation

1. Created comprehensive API documentation in README.md
2. Listed all endpoints with their correct versions and parameters
3. Documented the available MCP tools and their functionality

## Error Handling

Improved error handling to provide more descriptive error messages for different HTTP status codes and API-specific errors.

## Testing

1. Verified that the client can successfully connect to the API
2. Confirmed that the server starts successfully and can process requests
3. Added demo client for testing API integration

## Next Steps

- Add more robust error handling for specific API errors
- Implement pagination for large result sets
- Add caching to improve performance
- Consider adding more specific tools for OKR management (creation, updates, etc.)
